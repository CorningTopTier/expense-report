### Setting Up the Project Environment

To set up the project environment wit~h the required dependencies, please follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:CorningTopTier/expense-report.git
     cd expense-report
  ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:** We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Run the following command to create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
3. **Install Dependencies:** Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment:** When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```
